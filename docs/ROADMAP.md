# HexaRAG Development Roadmap

## Vision Statement

HexaRAG aims to be the premier hexagonal architecture implementation for building production-ready, retrieval-augmented conversational AI systems. Our goal is to provide developers with a clean, portable, and scalable foundation that can grow from local development to enterprise-scale deployments without architectural rewrites.

## Development Philosophy

- **Hexagonal Architecture First**: Every feature must maintain strict separation between business logic and infrastructure
- **Local-First Development**: Developers should be able to run the full system locally with minimal dependencies
- **Production-Ready**: All features must be designed with production deployment in mind
- **Test-Driven**: Comprehensive test coverage for all layers of the architecture
- **Community-Driven**: Open development with clear contribution guidelines
